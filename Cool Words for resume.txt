“Visual analytics combines automated analysis techniques with
interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning
and decision making on the basis of very large and complex datasets

Create tools and techniques to enable people to:
• Synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic,
ambiguous, and often conflicting data.
• Detect the expected and discover the unexpected.
• Provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments.
• Communicate these assessment effectively for action

effective, efficient, and the level of user acceptance

• Why users intend to use a visualization tool?
• What data users see?
• How the visual encoding and user interactions are implemented
from the point of view of design choices?


#Problem characterization
we describe specific issues of the application
domain and end users involved, such as the problem to solve, user
demands and datasets.

#Data and task abstractions
• We must make abstractions of the specific tasks and data
involved in the application domain and map them to generic
representations independent from the concrete application
domain.
• For tasks, we must identify the tasks required by end users in
their workflow.
• For example: explore, compare, resume.
• For data, the goal will be to determine which is the data type
that best fits user’s problem.
• Sometimes transformation is a better solution
