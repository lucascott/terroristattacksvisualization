0.- Two different type of analysis:
    0.1.- Analisys of the overall terrorism attacks
          - Cheese graphs showing most affected countries/regions by fatalities, number of attacks, most common motivation attacks.
          - Visualizing overall information for terrorist groups.
          
          MAP:
              - Coloring countries and info. with respect to number of attacks and fatalities.
              - Representing total groups activity.
              - Possibility to focus in specfific region visualizing extra info (clusters of attacks, etc...)
          
    0.2.- Analysis of the terrorism with respect to the year
    
          MAP:
              - Year slider popping up the attacks in each year (size: fatalities, color:terrorist group (perhaps for the first attack  of a terrorist group show the name and logo)). 
              - Perhaps implement two controlers in the bar to be able to show info in the map of a span of year (e.g.: 5 years slider).
              - Click on the attack for extra info., fatalities, economic impact, location.
              - Click on a country for info of attacks in the selected span of time (number of attacks, groups active in that country, number of fatalities)
        
          
          TIME-SERIES GRAPHS:
              - One single time serie graph changing info with checkboxes selector.
              - Time-serie graph of number of attacks
              - Time-serie graph of number of fatalities
              - Time-serie graph of number of group activity
1.- Geographical distribution of attacks with year slider, size of bubbles representing number of victims. Also group of terrorist (color), kidnap.

2.- Interactive map through checkboxes, focusing on specific regions.
3.- Time of the year and day of the week vs region and size.
4.- Kind and kind of weapon vs terrorist group and region.  
5.- Interactive clicking showing extra information about group, region, etc (filtering attributesâ€¦).
6.- Icon and images representing values of variables (++ visualization).
7.- Nationality of terrorists, victims and country.
8.- Increasing size countries regarding quantitative variables or appearances of categorical variables.
9.- Textbox filtering keywords with attacks.
